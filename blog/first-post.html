    Hello there — I'm Joshua, as you may have gathered. I intend for this blog to be a record of my musings and ramblings, so that one day I might cast a fond nostalgic gaze upon my youthful follies. I generally hope people have better things to do than read my thoughts, but if you've accidentally stumbled to this bland corner of the web, welcome! — feel free to look around.
